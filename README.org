* About
I am trying to make plotting program, for which I need text
drawing abiities. Since [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph_Bitmap_Distribution_Format][BDF]] fonts are easy to parse ASCII
files, so I choose to create a BDF parsing lib for common
lisp.

But please note that this project is still work in progress,
may not all the features are supported and hidden bugs are
possible.

Contribution and Issues are welcomed. 

* Usage
#+begin_src lisp
  (ql:quickload :cl-bdf)

  (defvar font (bdf:load-bdf-font "path/to/font.bdf"))

  ;; Have fun and good luck...
  (bdf:get-char font "A")                 ; => character A
#+end_src
